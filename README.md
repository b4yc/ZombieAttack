Android Game


This is a team project collaborated with other 5 guys, including two graphic designer and three other software
developers. All the materials are right by:

Software Developers: Tom prats, Lavanya Sivakumar, Jinqiu Deng, Yao Huang

Graphic Designers: Jessica Ruhl, Angela Hsieh

This project is built in Java Android SDK, which is version 2.2 based. I hope all versions of android 
phone can run it and have fun.

This is a final version of our game through so far. One of our purpose was to implement a feature that could let player
choose three kinds of boulders to complete the next level. However due to the limited time we had, we
skipped this feature, and used fixed boulder instead.

To run it on Android phones, just download the apk file which located in bin folder.
